                                Dental restorations and fillings are both used to repair decayed or damaged teeth, but they differ in the extent of damage they can address. Here's a brief overview of each:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dental fillings are used to repair small to moderate areas of decay or damage in a tooth. The decayed or damaged portion of the tooth is removed, and the resulting cavity is filled with a dental material such as amalgam, composite resin, or porcelain.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Fillings are typically recommended for:</strong></p>

                                Dental restorations are used to repair more extensive damage to a tooth, such as a large cavity, a broken or cracked tooth, or a tooth that has undergone root canal therapy. Restorations may include dental crowns, inlays, onlays, or overlays, and are typically made from materials such as porcelain, ceramic, or metal.

                            The cost of dental restorations and fillings can vary depending on the material used and the extent of damage to the tooth. In general, fillings are less expensive than restorations, but may need to be replaced more frequently over time. Your dentist can recommend the best treatment option based on your individual needs and budget.

                            <p class="cus-dental">
                                <strong><h5>There are several types of dental fillings, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Here are the most common types of dental fillings:</h5></strong>
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Amalgam fillings: </strong>These are silver-colored fillings made from a mixture of metals, including mercury, silver, tin, and copper. Amalgam fillings are strong and durable, and can withstand the forces of chewing. However, they are highly visible and can sometimes cause sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Composite fillings: </strong>These are tooth-colored fillings made from a mixture of resin and glass or quartz particles. Composite fillings are popular because they blend in with the natural color of the tooth and are less noticeable than amalgam fillings. They also require less removal of healthy tooth structure to place. However, they are not as durable as amalgam fillings and may need to be replaced more frequently.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Ceramic fillings: </strong>Also known as porcelain fillings, these are tooth-colored fillings made from a ceramic material that is strong, durable, and stain-resistant. Ceramic fillings are often used for larger cavities and can be custom-made to match the color of the surrounding teeth. However, they can be more expensive than other types of fillings.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Glass ionomer fillings: </strong>These are tooth-colored fillings made from a mixture of acrylic and glass particles. Glass ionomer fillings are often used for small cavities or to fill in areas of tooth root exposure. They release fluoride over time, which can help prevent decay. However, they are not as durable as other types of fillings and may need to be replaced more frequently.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Gold fillings: </strong>These are durable and long-lasting fillings made from a gold alloy. Gold fillings are strong and can withstand the forces of chewing, but they are more expensive and require more preparation of the tooth than other types of fillings.</li>

                               Your dentist can help you decide which type of filling is best for your needs based on the location and size of the cavity, your budget, and your personal preferences.

                            <ol>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Dental crowns: </strong>Dental crowns are also known as "caps" and are used to restore teeth that are extensively decayed, broken, or weakened. They cover the entire tooth, providing protection and support. Crowns can be made from a variety of materials, including porcelain, ceramic, metal, or a combination of materials.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Dental bridges: </strong>Dental bridges are used to replace one or more missing teeth. They consist of one or more artificial teeth (pontics) that are anchored in place using crowns on the adjacent teeth. Like crowns, bridges can be made from a variety of materials.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Inlays and onlays: </strong>Inlays and onlays are used to restore larger cavities or areas of decay. They are made from a dental impression of the affected tooth and are custom-fit to the cavity. Inlays and onlays are usually made from porcelain or ceramic and can be more durable than fillings.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Dental implants: </strong>Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth. They consist of a small titanium post that is surgically implanted into the jawbone, providing a sturdy base for an artificial tooth. Implants are durable and long-lasting but can be more expensive than other restorations.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Dentures: </strong>Dentures are removable appliances that are used to replace multiple missing teeth. They can be made from a variety of materials, including acrylic, porcelain, or a combination of materials.</li>

                            <h3>Teeth Filling or Tooth Restorations - Which is Best?</h3>
                            <p class="cus-dental">
                                <h5><strong>There are several benefits to full mouth implant planning, including:</strong></h5>
                            </p>
                            <p>The choice between teeth filling or tooth restoration depends on the extent of the damage to the tooth.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">If the damage is minor, such as a small cavity, a dental filling may be the best option. Dental fillings are typically made of materials like composite resin, porcelain or glass ionomer and are used to fill in the cavity and restore the tooth's natural shape and function. Fillings are a quick and cost-effective way to repair minor damage and can last for several years.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">If the damage is more extensive, a dental restoration may be necessary. Dental restorations are typically used to repair teeth that have been significantly damaged by decay or trauma, or teeth that are missing altogether. Restorations include dental crowns, bridges, inlays, and onlays, as well as dental implants and dentures. These restorations are custom-made to fit the patient's mouth and can restore the function and appearance of the damaged or missing teeth.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Your dentist can help you determine which option is best for your specific situation. Factors such as the location and severity of the damage, your overall oral health, and your budget will all play a role in determining the most appropriate treatment.</p>
