                            <p class="mb-4">Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a type of 3D imaging technology used in dentistry to provide detailed views of the teeth, jawbone, and other oral structures. CBCT uses a cone-shaped X-ray beam that rotates around the patient's head, capturing multiple images from different angles. These images are then reconstructed into a 3D image of the oral structures, allowing for a more detailed and accurate view compared to traditional 2D X-rays.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">CBCT is commonly used in dentistry for implant planning, orthodontic treatment planning, and diagnosing jaw disorders. It can provide information about the quality and density of the jawbone, the position of the nerves and other vital structures, and the location of impacted teeth. CBCT is also useful in diagnosing and planning treatment for conditions such as TMJ disorders, sinus problems, and oral cancer.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">While CBCT provides a more detailed view compared to traditional X-rays, it does expose patients to more radiation. However, the amount of radiation is still relatively low compared to medical CT scans, and the benefits of CBCT for diagnostic and treatment planning purposes often outweigh the risks. CBCT should only be used when necessary, and the amount of radiation exposure should always be minimized by using appropriate protocols and techniques.</p>

                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Better image quality: </strong>Digital X-rays provide clearer and more detailed images, which allows dentists to make more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Environmentally friendly: </strong>Digital X-rays do not require chemicals for film processing, which reduces the environmental impact of dental offices.</li>

                            <p>Intraoral cameras are small cameras that are designed to capture images of the inside of the mouth. They are commonly used in dentistry as a diagnostic tool to help dentists identify and diagnose dental problems.</p>
                            <p>Intraoral cameras are typically handheld devices that are about the size of a dental mirror. They feature a small camera on the end that can be inserted into the mouth to capture images of the teeth, gums, and other oral structures. The images are then displayed on a computer screen or monitor, where the dentist can review them in real-time.</p>
                            <h5><strong>Intraoral cameras offer several benefits over traditional dental mirrors and X-rays. For example:</strong></h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>More accurate diagnoses: </strong>Intraoral cameras can capture detailed images of the teeth and gums, which can help dentists identify dental problems that might not be visible to the naked eye.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Patient education: </strong>Intraoral cameras allow patients to see what's happening inside their mouth, which can help them better understand their dental health and treatment options.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Improved communication: </strong>Intraoral cameras allow dentists to easily share images with patients, other dental professionals, and insurance companies, which can improve communication and lead to better treatment outcomes.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Increased efficiency: </strong>Intraoral cameras can help dentists diagnose and treat dental problems more quickly and efficiently, which can save time and improve patient satisfaction.</li>

                                Panoramic X-rays, also known as panoramic radiographs, are a type of 2D dental imaging technology that captures a panoramic view of the entire mouth, including the teeth, jaws, and surrounding structures. Unlike traditional dental X-rays, which capture individual images of each tooth, a panoramic X-ray captures a single, wide-angle image that provides an overview of the entire oral cavity.

                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Reduced radiation exposure: </strong>Because panoramic X-rays capture a single image of the entire mouth, they use less radiation than traditional X-rays, which require multiple images to be taken.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Enhanced diagnostic capabilities: </strong>Panoramic X-rays provide a more comprehensive view of the entire oral cavity, which can help dentists identify a wide range of dental problems, including impacted teeth, cysts, tumors, and bone abnormalities.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Increased patient comfort: </strong>Panoramic X-rays are quick and easy to take, and they don't require any uncomfortable biting or positioning of the X-ray film.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Time savings: </strong>Because panoramic X-rays capture a wide-angle view of the entire mouth, they can be taken in less time than traditional X-rays.</li>

                            Panoramic X-rays are commonly used in a variety of dental procedures, including routine check-ups, orthodontic treatment planning, and implant placement. They are particularly useful for diagnosing complex dental problems and providing a comprehensive view of the entire oral cavity.

                        <p>
                            Overall, panoramic X-rays offer several benefits over traditional dental X-rays, including reduced radiation exposure, enhanced diagnostic capabilities, increased patient comfort, and time savings.

                            <p>
                                Digital models, also known as digital impressions, are a modern dental technology that allows dentists to create 3D digital images of a patient's teeth and gums. Digital models are created using a special scanner that captures detailed images of the teeth and gums, which are then used to create a virtual 3D model of the patient's mouth.
                            </p>

                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Increased accuracy: </strong>Digital models are more accurate than traditional dental impressions, as they can capture detailed images of the teeth and gums from all angles.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Improved patient comfort: </strong>Digital models are less invasive and more comfortable for patients, as they do not require the use of messy impression materials.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Time savings: </strong>Digital models can be created quickly and easily, which saves time for both the dentist and the patient.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Enhanced treatment planning: </strong>Digital models allow dentists to better visualize the patient's mouth and teeth, which can help with treatment planning and communication with the patient.</li>

                        </div>

                            Digital models are commonly used in a variety of dental procedures, including orthodontic treatment planning, implant placement, and the creation of custom dental restorations such as crowns and bridges. They offer several benefits over traditional dental impressions, including increased accuracy, improved patient comfort, time savings, and enhanced treatment planning.
