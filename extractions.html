                            <p class="">
                                Full mouth dental implants may be recommended for patients who have lost all or most of their teeth due to severe decay, gum disease, trauma, or other reasons. Full mouth dental implants are a popular option for patients who want a long-term, durable solution for restoring their smile, improving their oral health, and regaining their ability to speak and eat comfortably.
                            </p>
                            <p class="cus-dental">

                                <li class="cus-dental">Gum disease that has caused the tooth to become loose</li>

                                The extraction process typically involves the use of local anesthesia to numb the area around the tooth, followed by the use of specialized tools to loosen and remove the tooth from its socket in the jawbone. After the tooth is removed, the patient may experience some pain and swelling, which can usually be managed with over-the-counter pain medication and ice packs.

They may also take X-rays of the affected tooth or teeth to help plan the extraction procedure.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Fasting: </strong>The patient may be instructed to fast for a certain period of time before the procedure to reduce the risk of complications from anesthesia.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Medications: </strong>Depending on the patient's medical history and the complexity of the extraction, the dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to be taken before or after the procedure.</li>

                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Recovery period: </strong>After the tooth extraction, the patient will need to rest and allow the mouth to heal. The length of the recovery period can vary depending on the complexity of the procedure and the individual patient's healing time.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Pain management: </strong>The patient may experience some pain and swelling after the procedure, which can typically be managed with over-the-counter pain medication and ice packs.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Rest and activity: </strong>The patient should avoid strenuous activity and rest as much as possible in the first few days after the extraction. They should also avoid smoking and drinking through a straw, as these actions can disrupt the healing process.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Oral hygiene: </strong>The patient should continue to brush and floss their teeth as normal, but should avoid brushing the extraction site for the first 24 hours. After that, they can gently brush the area to keep it clean.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Follow-up: </strong>The dentist or oral surgeon will typically schedule a follow-up appointment to check on the healing process and remove any stitches that were used during the procedure.</li>

                            <p>
                                <h5><strong>After a tooth extraction, patients may experience some side effects. While most side effects are mild and temporary, it's important to be aware of them to ensure proper healing and prevent complications. Some common side effects of tooth extraction include:</strong></h5>
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Pain and discomfort: </strong>It's common to experience some pain and discomfort after a tooth extraction, especially in the first few days. The dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe pain medication to manage the pain.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Swelling: </strong>Swelling around the extraction site is normal and may last for several days. Applying ice packs to the affected area can help reduce swelling.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Bleeding: </strong>A small amount of bleeding is normal after a tooth extraction, but if the bleeding is heavy or doesn't stop after a few hours, the patient should contact their dentist or oral surgeon.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Infection: </strong>Infection is a rare but serious complication of tooth extraction. Patients should follow their dentist's instructions for oral hygiene and avoid smoking or drinking through a straw to reduce the risk of infection.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Numbness: </strong>Numbness or tingling in the lips, tongue, or cheek is normal after a tooth extraction, but it should subside within a few hours. If numbness persists for more than a few hours, the patient should contact their dentist.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Dry socket: </strong>Dry socket is a painful condition that can occur when the blood clot that forms after a tooth extraction is dislodged, exposing the bone and nerves in the socket. Patients should avoid smoking and follow their dentist's instructions for proper oral hygiene to reduce the risk of dry socket.</li>
                                <li class="cus-dental"><strong>Jaw stiffness: </strong>It's common to experience some stiffness in the jaw muscles after a tooth extraction, especially if the procedure was complex. Gentle stretching exercises and warm compresses can help reduce jaw stiffness.</li>
                                <!-- <li class="cus-dental"><strong></strong></li> -->

                        </div>
                        <p>It's important for patients to follow their dentist's instructions for post-operative care and to contact their dentist if they experience any concerning symptoms after a tooth extraction.</p>

                            It's important to discuss the potential pros and cons of tooth extraction with a dental professional before making a decision. In some cases, other dental treatments or procedures may be able to address the issue without the need for extraction.

                            <h3>Pricing for teeth Extractions</h3>
                           <p class="mt-4 mb-4">The cost of tooth extractions in Chennai, India can vary depending on various factors such as the complexity of the extraction, the type of tooth being extracted, the experience and qualifications of the dentist or oral surgeon performing the procedure, and the location of the dental clinic. Generally, the cost of tooth extractions in Chennai can range from approximately INR 500 to INR 10,000 per tooth.</p>
                           <p class="mb-4">It's important to note that the cost may also vary depending on the type of anesthesia used during the procedure, with general anesthesia typically being more expensive than local anesthesia. Additionally, the cost may be higher for complex extractions or for patients with certain medical conditions that require additional precautions or specialized equipment.</p>
                           <p class="mb-4">It's recommended to consult with a dental professional in Chennai to discuss the specifics of your case and receive an accurate cost estimate for tooth extraction. Dental clinics in Chennai may offer package deals or discounts for multiple extractions or for patients with dental insurance, so it's worth asking about these options as well.</p>
